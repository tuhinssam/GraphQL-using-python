### GraphQL using Python

#### Graphene package

Graphene is a library that provides tools to implement a GraphQL API in Python using a code-first approach.

Compare Grapheneâ€™s code-first approach to building a GraphQL API with schema-first approaches like Apollo Server (JavaScript) or Ariadne (Python). Instead of writing GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL), we write Python code to describe the data provided by your server.

Graphene is fully featured with integrations for the most popular web frameworks and ORMs. Graphene produces schemas that are fully compliant with the GraphQL spec and provides tools and patterns for building a Relay-Compliant API as well.

#### GraphQL features implemented

- Simple schema
- Schema with parameters
